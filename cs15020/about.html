						First of all I would like to credit Oliver Fisher for his help in suggesting ideas to consider and also helping me sort a few issues such as appropriate spacing and positioning I ran into.
					</p>
 
					<p>
						None of the areas I found particularly hard or problematic, for the most part I used lectures slides,notes and tutorials on html.net to guide me through any particularly confusing parts. <br/> 
						I had my greatest problem I would say with the JavaScript accepting my form data and posting it related to time of day as I had the JavaScript for time of day right and i was fine making the form it was implementing them both together which made for a harder ordeal.<br/>
						In the end using examples and some advice from Oliver I managed to figure it out and after some trail and error managed to get it working with few issues.<br/>
						I lead with a simple design with header side menu and a main section. to make it look a bit more artistic I used some css3 techniques and then incorporated the CV, the form and this write up into the main section.
					</p>

					<p> 
						Overall I think I tackled the assignment in an effective manner and made good headway before need advice It taught me that its relatively simple to create a basic yet effective website in a short space of time. I tested the site on IE, Chrome and fire fox on windows 8.1 and also chrome and Firefox on Ubuntu and mint. I also checked it worked on my phone an Iphone 4s.
